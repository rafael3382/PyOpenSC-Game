# PyOpenSC-Game
This is a project that tries to look like Survivalcraft but open source, We don't want to have a problem because it looks like piracy, so we are going to make an anti-piracy layer

# the focuses are:
be realistic but still with blocks,
In the future an electric version,
Upgrade faster than survivalcraft, 
and always try to be better than survivalcraft


# Are we pirating? and the license of the original game does not allow this
the original game is necessary to activate this "copy"

Our goal is not and will never be to pirate survivalcraft, we also want permission from kaalus as soon as possible

Our goal is to improve it, when kaalus is alone doing everything, we will have a community that will be better

We hope that no one uses our game for piracy.
